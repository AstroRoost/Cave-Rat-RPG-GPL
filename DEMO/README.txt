Current Objectives
==========
- Craftable Slime Balls 
-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies

 - Will dive deep onto IMGUI to make a crafting table of sorts
- basic INV [depending on the item size, it will take up horizontal/vertical space] -IMGUI
== Sketch_overview_inv_basic_info_graph_in_progress.png as a basic sketch overview of the INV system ==

    - That is basically going to be the bridge for making the slime balls the next step forward for this mini GPL project
	- Viva revolution (Í â‰– ÍœÊ–Í â‰–)ðŸ‘Œ

=========
- Once slime balls/crafting is added will work on adding the mini boss, boss, more enemy types (meele/range)

=========
-After the enemy has been improved will work on

- menu, credit bar
- Add Controller support

=========
- Next big objective

- Add multiplayer, chat log, commands

=========
- The third support structure for this mini project and the main project would be 

-Loot drops/destructible blocks

=========

================
-Expirment Phase : Steam Addon
================
-Create Steam Demo Page to get educated on the process
-Achievements, community tab, published, etc,etc
=======
Side Updates later on
-Diverse levels, to suit the mini boss / boss, will consider it later

-Enable player customized chara's before fully starting the game with an option to enable, commands/cheats, enable certain enemy types

=========
-Most likely for:
===============
-Enable player customized chara's before fully starting the game with an option to enable, commands/cheats, enable certain enemy types
-pvp enable, or pve, level gen, etc

will have that for the 2nd main project, which will be used as the foundation for the OG purpose of this mini project
-Instead of being 2d, it will be 3D and bit more closer to the OG objective we've had at VillagerPvP
