-v4 Quick Demo Preview: Added in a quick demo preview called "Cave_Rat_RPG_GPL", it is in folder DEMO
			to run the demo will need to click on Cave_Rat_RPG_GPL/Cave_Rat_RPG/Cave_Rat_RPG.exe
			
			Also include a README.txt on Cave_Rat_RPG_GPL on the same steps as well.
 
-v4.1 Added Main Menu Music: Figured to do a quick addon on Main Menu Music once the game loads.
				Main Menu music location: ../resources/main_menu/music 
				
				As of now getting educated on Itchi.io and gamejolt publishing before 
				updating the demo even further

-4.2 Itchio page account & more:

Updated preview:
# Basic_SFML_RPG - Cave Rat RPG
Basic SFML RPG w/ multiplayer - used as a quick reference pt for a server project main component- VillagerPvP.
-v0 Update README.md : As of now will keep this respo blank until the main components are completed, so it can be "ready in the box" for those that wish to learn / implement your own creativity to your own projects

  ============================= 
- Cave Rat inspiration? 
  ============================= 
     Tunnel Rats, made a documentation while back for ~~college~~ HS about Vietnam war, kept it back of my mind. Figured to make a Fantasy esc setting, with some features from VillagerPvP MC inspiration. Some tweaks from PACKT edu documentation, bing bang boom - Cave Rat RPG is born. kek

- Expect this project to be more so educational/reference/hobby/etc.
Quite enjoy debugging and adding in tweaks, addons, etc. Very fulfilling, and yup once the GPL demo is on Steam it will be M-rate due to "Gore" lel.

#Tribal Class & Other Additions
=========
--Quick_preview_Cave_Rat_RPG_GPL: https://youtu.be/IZ7tkWwrIeM

-v2 objectives previous objectives:
 -Loot Drops , better basic gore,   player screen damage effect,
			menu, credit bar, multiplayer, chat log, commands, buff/debuff male||female , basic INV, 
			bit more mob enemy types, Create Steam Demo Page to get educated on the process

--Current completion
  * buff/debuff male||female - natural gender boost
		-Females: Faster/higher mana re-gen , more nimble = speed
		-Male: Higher defense, attack, stamina re-gen 
	
 * new class & species improvment: Gnomes added, with new class : Tribal
	- Added "tribal" music theme during the dungeon runs with a *twist
	-Enemies will bleed more / leave trail at a better rate  (will work on making it perm instead of clearing once the enemy dies,
	since its more of a visual feature, will leave that alone for now, functionality is main focus atm)
-Tribal Introduction: https://youtu.be/FWXlmLU4A_Q

	- Added music change Numpad9, music mute Numpad8

	-Will include +/- music volume in later updates

	-Slimes will not leave any "corpses" at the moment
		-Updating them so they will drop slime balls, in which you can use to slow down large groups of enemies
		-The corpse will be added later

==========
Current Objectives
==========

- Skeletons upon death will drop mana potion, and leave a "mana blood trail". They will still bleed red, since they were once "alive"
	The mana just helps "revitalize" the body a bit, technically the other mobs and the player has mana, however to make the skeleton
function, they just need an extra juice at least x3-5 times than the safe amount.

-include +/- music volume


- Slime drop balls and better slime corspse death state
-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies

-Add mini boss & boss

- player screen damage effect
- improve menu, credit bar
- Add multiplayer, chat log, commands

-v5.95 Slime Info: Slime will turn "grey" upon death, due to the microorganisms no longer producing their output color. Color comes from the stuff they absorbed. With the lack of the slime innard, keeping
			the "structure" becomes impossible and falls apart, majority of the microorganisms will die, some will live and become small slimes.

			On the main project, will go a bit more in-depth , inspiration comes for irl - pond esc life :P kek

==========
Current Objectives
==========

- Slime drop balls and better slime corspse death state 

-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies 
=============
Pyromancer x Zombie Addition
=============
-v6 Pyromancer x Zombie Addition [X]:
			-Added zombie enemy, and  a new class called Pyromancer
			Pyromancer is tad bit stronger than the mage, with 
		
	case PLAYER_CLASS::PYROMANCER:
		m_defense += std::rand() % 6 + 5;
		m_stamina += std::rand() % 5 + 7;
		m_attack += std::rand() % 2 + 3;
		m_speed += std::rand() % 200 + 20;
		className = "pyromancer";
		break;

while the Mage is
	case PLAYER_CLASS::MAGE:
		m_attack += std::rand() % 1 + 3;
		m_defense += std::rand() % 6 + 5;
		m_stamina += std::rand() % 3 + 5;
		m_speed += std::rand() % 195 + 15;	
		className = "mage";
		break;


- Add a "fireball" for the Pyromancer to use as its main attack [X]

-Added zombie as an addon enemy for the dungeon run.[X]

==========
Current Objectives
==========
- Craftable Slime Balls 
-Slime ball functionality : slow down enemies

 - Will dive deep onto IMGUI to make a crafting table of sorts
- basic INV [depending on the item size, it will take up horizontal/vertical space] -IMGUI
== Sketch_overview_inv_basic_info_graph_in_progress.png as a basic sketch overview of the INV system ==

    - That is basically going to be the bridge for making the slime balls the next step forward for this mini GPL project
	- Viva revolution (Õ†‚âñ Õú ñÕ†‚âñ)üëå

=========
- Once slime balls/crafting is added will work on adding the mini boss, boss, more enemy types (meele/range)

=========
-After the enemy has been improved will work on

- menu, credit bar
- Add Controller support

=========
- Next big objective

- Add multiplayer, chat log, commands

=========
- The third support structure for this mini project and the main project would be 

-Loot drops/destructible blocks

=========

================
-Expirment Phase : Steam Addon
================
-Create Steam Demo Page to get educated on the process
-Achievements, community tab, published, etc,etc
=======
Side Updates later on
-Diverse levels, to suit the mini boss / boss, will consider it later

-Enable player customized chara's before fully starting the game with an option to enable, commands/cheats, enable certain enemy types
-pvp enable, or pve, level gen, etc
=========
-Most likely for:
===============
-Enable player customized chara's before fully starting the game with an option to enable, commands/cheats, enable certain enemy types
-pvp enable, or pve, level gen, etc

will have that for the 2nd main project, which will be used as the foundation for the OG purpose of this mini project
-Instead of being 2d, it will be 3D and bit more closer to the OG objective we've had at VillagerPvP

- Will update respo once -V6: Current Objectives are completed - IMGUI main focus at the moment
                                                     
- Yea I know I said will update this when -V6 is completed, however cannot let this go past my mind lol, the Boss v0 has been found https://soundcloud.com/sonic4925/mogolovonio?si=2db89baf73694657b8f52a619474c01b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing , and theres nothing can change that lmao

- IMGUI setup is going great, getting exp on the process as FYI, just fig to add that in lol
==========
- Created SECURITY.md - Contact, Recognition, Privacy, Safety, etc
	-Figured to add this ahead of time before adding in the src code later. Will update the other tab features for this respo and for others (Wiki, Issues, Security, etc).
	- One step at a time (üëâ Õ°‚ñÄÃø Ãø‚ÄØÕú ñ Õ°‚ñÄÃø Ãø ) üëâ

-V6.6 Contrib_Asteroids_Araime: Forked/Star [Araime](https://github.com/Araime/Asteroids) , will contrib to the project a bit, add documentation, couple of improvement of life features/controls, 
                               & most importantly IMGUI experiments. Most likely an IMGUI cheat, infinite HP, and other game addition goodies. Once that is completed will be adding the IMGUI features onto this project, to
				complete the INV/crafting objective at hand.
