# Basic_SFML_RPG - Cave Rat RPG
Basic SFML RPG w/ multiplayer - used as a quick reference pt for a server project main component- VillagerPvP.
-v0 Update README.md : As of now will keep this respo blank until the main components are completed, so it can be "ready in the box" for those that wish to learn / implement your own creativity to your own projects


  ============================= 
- Cave Rat inspiration? 
  ============================= 
     Tunnel Rats, made a documentation while back for ~~college~~ HS about Vietnam war, kept it back of my mind. Figured to make a Fantasy esc setting, with some features from VillagerPvP MC inspiration. Some tweaks from PACKT edu documentation, bing bang boom - Cave Rat RPG is born. kek

- Expect this project to be more so educational/reference/hobby/etc.
Quite enjoy debugging and adding in tweaks, addons, etc. Very fulfilling, and yup once the GPL demo is on Steam it will be M-rate due to "Gore" lel.

GPL 4 All (👍▀̿ ̿̀ ͜ʖ ́▀̿ ̿ )👍
  =============================   
 - This of course will be GPL, and for those that would like to know a bit of what GPL is all about:
   
  ============================= 
  =============================    
 - Freedom to Run the Program: Users can run the licensed software for any purpose without restrictions.

 - Freedom to Study and Modify: Users have access to the source code, the freedom to study how the program works, and the ability to modify it to perform as they wish.

 - Freedom to Distribute Copies: Users can redistribute the original software or their modified versions.

- Freedom to Distribute Modified Versions: Users can distribute modified versions of the software, allowing the community to benefit from the improvements.

- Source Code: The license requires that the source code be made available to anyone who receives a copy of the binary/compiled version.

- Copyleft: The license is "copyleft," which means that any derivative work must be distributed under the same license terms. This ensures that the freedoms granted by the GPLv3 continue to apply to all versions of the software.

- Protection Against Tivoization: GPLv3 has provisions to prevent "Tivoization," which refers to the practice of using hardware restrictions to prevent modified versions of the software from running.

- Protection Against Patent Actions: It includes an explicit patent license, which grants users rights to use the patented technology that might be necessary to operate the software.

- Compatibility with Other Licenses: It includes certain provisions for compatibility with other open-source licenses.

- Freedom to Charge a Fee: The GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3) allows you to sell the software or your modifications to someone else. Economic transactions are permitted under the license, and you can charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, or you can charge for warranty or support services if you wish. However, if you distribute the software to anyone, they must also receive the same freedoms under the GPLv3, including the source code and the rights to modify and redistribute it.  

The GPLv3 is designed to protect the four freedoms of free software and to protect against newer challenges that have emerged in the software industry since the creation of GPLv2. If you're using or distributing software licensed under GPLv3, it's important to understand these terms to comply with the license requirements.

- Can expect @MabiStory ( https://twitter.com/MabiiStory ) code will also be under GPL as well. Should make it easier for server owners & general players/ or ppl looking to learn a bit; more easier to modify their personal experience while having updates that MC should have had long time ago. These "false gods" shall no longer limit your potential with the heritical codex called Java. No need to fear being banished from the realms of MC by those that fear your competition like attitude on a faction like server. Want to advance past the stone age? Want better mobs that coordinate? Build structures that can hold off attackers? Explore on an actual Cube planet with resources limited by the region & biome? Strategies your path through victory. Expand your territory, and make both direct & in-direct impact on your local region and your planet.

- MabiStory repo will be published once a flag is placed onto the "test-world"
